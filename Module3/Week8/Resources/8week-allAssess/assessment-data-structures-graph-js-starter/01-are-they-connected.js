/*******************************************************************************
In this assessment, you will write a function that allow you to search a graph
using its adjacency list to determine if one node is "connected" to another.

For example, consider the following adjacency list that connects names of people
together:

```js
const adjacencyList = {
  'carrie':  ['humza', 'jun'],
  'farrah':  ['humza'],
  'humza':   ['carrie', 'farrah', 'jun', 'silla'],
  'jun':     ['carrie', 'silla'],
  'ophelia': ['travis'],
  'silla':   ['humza', 'yervand'],
  'travis':  ['ophelia'],
  'ursula':  ['travis'],
  'victor':  [],
  'yervand': ['silla'],
};
```

Your function will take a starting name and an ending name. Your function will
search the graph to determine if you could get from one name to another.

In this function, as is not usually in real life, these interpersonal
relationships are a one-way street. Look at the entry for "ursula". You can find
a path between "ursula" and "ophelia" using "ursula" -> "travis" -> "ophelia".
However, if you were asked to start at "ophelia" and try to get to "ursula",
that would fail because it goes "ophelia" -> "travis" -> _DEAD END_.

Given a start name, an end name, and the adjacency list from above, the
following table shows the result and a possible (not necessarily unique) path
that it could find to determine if two names are connected.

| Start name | End name | Result    | Example path found by a search    |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| carrie     | carrie   | true      | carrie (it's the same node)       |
| carrie     | humza    | true      | carrie -> humza                   |
| carrie     | yervand  | true      | carrie -> jun -> silla -> yervand |
| ophelia    | ursula   | **FALSE** | ophelia -> travis -> **FAIL**     |
| travis     | carrie   | **FALSE** | travis -> ophelia -> **FAIL**     |
| ursula     | ophelia  | true      | ursula -> travis -> ophelia       |
| victor     | humza    | **FALSE** | victory -> **FAIL**               |

@param {Object} adjacencyList - An object that has at least one key, that
being the value of startName. The values of all keys in the adjacencyList are
guaranteed to be arrays.

@param {string} startName - The name (node) at which you'll start your
search.

@param {sting} endName - The name (node) you're trying to find when starting
your search from startName.
