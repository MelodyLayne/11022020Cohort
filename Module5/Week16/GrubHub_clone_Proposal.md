My cloning proposal is based on GrubHub. The twists I include are several, not all of which would be implemented in the week of this project. They are as follows.
1. Rather than provide contract employees, they restaurant will be allowed to use their own.
2. Instead of charging a percentage fee, the restaurant pays a flat license fee plus a monthly charge for the number of employees using the system.
3. The app will allow the restaurant to build their menu items with a UI system that will link to the customer view. (Thinking recipe box but with more power.)
4. The app will be scalable to have employee login functions for the in store employees, allowing them to input orders digitally from a tablet right at the point of interaction with the guest.
5. The app will eventually integrate with the restaurant's vendors via api's to allow for inventory management and better cost analysis.
