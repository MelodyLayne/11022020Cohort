## Possible answers - double check for accuracy
### Option 1
The router is used to transfer IP packets between networks. This differs from switches and hubs, because hubs transfer packets of information to every device connected, and switches will transfer packets of information, to a specific device using the MAC address. These two devices transfer between the local network, but routers transfer packets between other networks.

### Option 2
The router can route data from the network and map an IP address to a MAC address to form a connection.They have access to an IP address table, whereas switches only have access to a MAC address table, and hubs don't keep track of networks at all and simply flood the entire local network with every receive.

### Option 3
I think the big takeaway is that routers route connections between other networks. 

### Option 4
Routers are used to connect networks via ip addresses vs switches connecting hardware via mac address routers are more efficient bc they use NAT to assign one ip per router at a cost of additional processing requirements wrote some like bs line about the address table and just like summarized how routers are bes girl bc routers oftentimes include hubs and switches inside them as well and basically do everything hubs and switches do on top of its network connecting functionality
